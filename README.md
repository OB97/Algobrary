Algorithm Library!

- I want to create a library for myself to practice implementing concepts learned in my computer science degree from data structures to machine learning algorithms.

- I think applying the theories we learn to real programs is the most efficient way to make the information stick.

- Eventually I think I could implement data visualization tools, like step-by-step searching and sorting, or animation-style visuals
